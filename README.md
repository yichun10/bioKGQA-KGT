# Knowledge Graph-based Thought: a knowledge graph enhanced LLMs framework for pan-cancer question answering
## Introduction
In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, notably in biomedical sciences. However, their real-world application is often limited by issues like erroneous outputs and hallucinatory responses. We developed the Knowledge Graph-based Thought (KGT) framework, an innovative solution that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve their initial responses by utilizing verifiable information from KGs, thus significantly reducing factual errors in reasoning. To evaluate the Knowledge Graph Question Answering task within biomedicine, we utilize a pan-cancer knowledge graph to develop a pan-cancer question answering benchmark, named the Pan-cancer Question Answering (PcQA). The KGT framework demonstrates strong adaptability and performs well across various open-source LLMs, exceeding the current best methods by 33\%. This achievement positions our approach as a pioneering benchmark in biomedical KGQA, eclipsing previously established best practices. Notably, KGT facilitates the discovery of new uses for existing drugs through potential drug-cancer associations, and can assist in predicting resistance by analyzing relevant biomarkers and genetic mechanisms. The KGT framework substantially improves the accuracy and utility of LLMs in the biomedical field, demonstrating its exceptional performance in biomedical question answering.

Fig. 2. Framework of KGT. (A) Question analysis. Decompose the question and extract its key information. (B) Graph Schema-based inference. Input
the types of the head and tail entities into the graph schema of the knowledge graph, complete the graph reasoning, and obtain the optimal relational
chain pattern. (C) Subgraph construction. Generate a query statement and retrieve the subgraph. (D) Inference. Complete the final reasoning and
output the results in natural language.

## Demo

Due to limited resources, we currently only provide an online demo without Graph Schema-based inference. You can visit https://ed5c004ee6ce1e7f5f.gradio.live. If you need a complete online demo, you can send an email to fengyichun22@mails.ucas.ac.cn. We suggest downloading the model for local testing.

Please note that if the link https://ed5c004ee6ce1e7f5f.gradio.live is invalid, it may be due to infrequent updates, and you can also send an email to request an update.

## Environments Setting
1、In a conda env with PyTorch / CUDA available clone and download this repository.

2、In the top-level directory run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Data preparation
1、You can obtain the PcQA.json from the dataset folder, which is a dataset containing 405 question-answer pairs. 

2、We make a portion of our knowledge graph available for public use. You can build the knowledge graph locally based on the 'knowledge graph' folder, which can be used to validate our entire dataset.

3、For access to the complete SmartQuerier Oncology Knowledge Graph, please contact at service@smartquerier.com.

### Downloading the Required LLMs
You can download the corresponding model from the official website. For instance, if you need to download CodeLlama, you can visit the https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct-hf/tree/main.
You can also visit the link below to download llama2:
https://huggingface.co/meta-llama

Please save the downloaded model in bioKGQA/model.

Note: If the Codellama downloaded from the official website cannot be used directly, you can complete the conversion according to the following steps.

1、In the downloaded folder, such as CodeLlama-13b Instrument, create a new folder 13d_hf.

2、Run the following code directly.
```bash
python /Tools/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir /bioKGQA/model/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct --model_size 13B --output_dir /bioKGQA/model/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct/13b_hf
```
The download addresses for some LLMs are as follows:

Zephyr-7b: https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta/tree/main

Taiyi: https://huggingface.co/DUTIR-BioNLP/Taiyi-LLM/tree/main
### Quick Start
You can directly run the following code to complete basic inference.
```bash
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model1 = "/bioKGQA/model/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct/13b_hf" #Your model path
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model1)
pipeline1 = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model1,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto", 
)
question = "" #Enter your question
prompt = """
You are a reasoning robot, and answer my question using natural language.
"""
input_text1 = prompt+question
sequences = pipeline1(
    input_text1,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=10,
    return_full_text=False,
    top_p = 0.7,  
    temperature = 0.1,
    num_return_sequences=1,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    max_length=1000, 
)
for seq in sequences:
    lines = seq['generated_text'].split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip(): 
            out=line
            break  
print(out)
```

### KGT Test
1、You can obtain the user_input.py from the method folder.
```bash
link1 = Graph("address", auth=("neo4j", "password"))# KG information.
file_path = './dataset/PcQA.json'  # Replace with your test JSON file path
model1 = "./model/codellama/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct/13b_hf" #Your model path
```
Note: You can build a knowledge graph based on the readme in the 'knowledge graph' folder to obtain KG information.
2、After filling in the above information, run the main.py directly.
```bash
python method/main.py
```
Note: If you have not filled in the correct knowledge graph address and password, you may receive an error message.

Note: If the Codellama downloaded from the official website cannot be used directly, you can complete the conversion according to the following steps.

1、In the downloaded folder, such as CodeLlama-13b Instrument, create a new folder 13d_hf.

2、Run the following code directly.
```bash
python /Tools/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir /model/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct --model_size 13B --output_dir /model/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct/13b_hf
```
### Evaluation
We have designed three evaluation methods: ROUGE, BERT score, and an evaluator based on GPT-4. You simply need to enter the paths for the test set and the path for the generated answers in the corresponding fields to run it directly.
```bash
with open('/answer/codellama13_PcQA.json', 'r') as file:
    test_datas = json.load(file)

with open('/dataset/PcQA.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

```
With the above information modified, run the following code in top-level folder.
```bash
python evaluation/rouge.py
```
